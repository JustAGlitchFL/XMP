# eXpandable Motion Platform
Integrated mirrorless camera motion platform for dynamic videography, fast-moving target tracking, and stabilization.

Core components:
- 3-axis high-torque gimbal for tracking fast-moving objects and rotationally stabilizing camera rigs when vehicle-mounted
- Modular sectioned arm for dynamic motion, also incorporates a linear stabilizing element for use while vehicle-mounted
- Slider base for expanded motion range
- Adaptable focus and zoom motors to control lenses
- Link with [BEAM](https://github.com/justaglitchfl/beam), a LiDAR autofocus and target detection system
